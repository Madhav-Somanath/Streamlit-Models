# Streamlit-Models
A repository to hold all Machine Learning models deployed using Streamlit.

## What is Streamlit?
Streamlit’s open-source app framework is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours!  All in pure Python. All for free.

## Note
To proceed with this project you need to install Streamlit, check it out [here](https://www.streamlit.io/)

#### Installing Streamlit
```
pip3 install streamlit
```
Make sure to install inside a custom environment to avoid hassles later (totally happened to me)

#### Deploying the model
```
streamlit run <model-name>.py
```

## Projects:
